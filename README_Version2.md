# Air Quality Index Forecasting

This project forecasts the Air Quality Index (AQI) for future dates using time series modeling. It is a Python-based web application (without a graphical user interface) that leverages the Facebook Prophet model for accurate AQI predictions.

## Features

- Forecasts future AQI values based on historical data.
- Utilizes the powerful [Facebook Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) time series forecasting model.
- Simple web app (no GUI) — ideal for backend integration or API-based usage.
- Provides confidence intervals alongside forecasts.

## Example Output

Below is an example forecast of the AQI generated by the model:

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AkhilPadma/Air-Quality-Index-.git
   cd Air-Quality-Index-
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install prophet pandas matplotlib flask
   ```

3. **Run the app**
   The application can be started with:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   (Replace `app.py` with your entry point filename if different.)

4. **Usage**
   - The app runs as a backend service (no visual frontend).
   - Input historical AQI data as expected by the code (typically a CSV with columns `ds` for date and `y` for AQI value).
   - Access endpoints or results as per your implementation.

## Project Structure

- `app.py` — Main application script.
- `model/` — (Optional) Contains model code or saved Prophet models.
- `data/` — (Optional) Contains sample or historical AQI data.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies (if available).

## Dependencies

- [prophet](https://pypi.org/project/prophet/)
- pandas
- matplotlib
- flask

## Methodology

The project uses Facebook Prophet, a robust time series forecasting library, to analyze historical AQI data and predict future trends. Prophet is well-suited for handling seasonality, trends, and missing data, making it ideal for environmental and atmospheric datasets.

## Example Plot

The plot above shows actual AQI values (black dots), the forecasted trend (blue line), and the uncertainty interval (shaded region).
