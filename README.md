**Air Quality Index Forecasting**

This project forecasts the Air Quality Index (AQI) for future dates using time series modeling. It is a Python-based web application (without a graphical user interface) that leverages the Facebook Prophet model for accurate AQI predictions.

Features
Forecasts future AQI values based on historical data.
Utilizes the powerful Facebook Prophet time series forecasting model.
Simple web app (no GUI) — ideal for backend integration or API-based usage.
Provides confidence intervals alongside forecasts.
Example Output
Below is an example forecast of the AQI generated by the model:

Setup Instructions
Clone this repository

git clone https://github.com/AkhilPadma/Air-Quality-Index-.git
cd Air-Quality-Index-
Install dependencies Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher. Install required packages:

pip install prophet pandas matplotlib flask
Run the app The application can be started with:

python app.py
(Replace app.py with your entry point filename if different.)

Usage

The app runs as a backend service (no visual frontend).
Input historical AQI data as expected by the code (typically a CSV with columns ds for date and y for AQI value).
Access endpoints or results as per your implementation.
Project Structure
app.py — Main application script.
model/ — (Optional) Contains model code or saved Prophet models.
data/ — (Optional) Contains sample or historical AQI data.
requirements.txt — Python dependencies (if available).
Dependencies
prophet
pandas
matplotlib
flask
Methodology
The project uses Facebook Prophet, a robust time series forecasting library, to analyze historical AQI data and predict future trends. Prophet is well-suited for handling seasonality, trends, and missing data, making it ideal for environmental and atmospheric datasets.

Example Plot
The plot above shows actual AQI values (black dots), the forecasted trend (blue line), and the uncertainty interval (shaded region).
